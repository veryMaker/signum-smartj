/**
 * A Non-Fungible Token smart contract with DEX and auction capabilities.
 * 
 * This contract represents a non-fungible or unique token for Burst blockchain.
 * 
 * When created the contract is <i>owned</i> by the creator. After that, the
 * owner can transfer the ownership to another address. Additionally, the owner
 * can put the token for sale or for auction with a given timeout.
 *
 * Although this was inspired by http://erc721.org/, the mechanics are very
 * different. For instance, there is one contract <i>instance</i> per token and
 * each token is already a decentralized exchange (DEX) with absolutely no
 * middle man.
